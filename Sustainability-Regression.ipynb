We see the that least error (optimum solution) is available when no. of variables taken is 6 (considering model variables taken from 4 - 10 numbers)\n","\n","2. Based on predicted vs actual values (consider t<=4) we see that predicted values match with those of the actual CO2 emissions for all countries Canada and Finland, with the predicted values having very high deviation from actual for Finland. \n","\n","3. We see highest error value when no. of constraints taken are 7  and 11\n","\n","4. We Columbia has the lowest CO2 emissions compared to all other countries.\n","\n","5. We suggest that for prediction of CO2, EN.CLC.HPPT.MM (average annual precipitation) is the variable with the most significance and is negatively correlated to the CO2 emissions EN.ATM.CO2E.KT series.\n","\n","6. Similarly the SP.POP.TOTL (total population) variable has the least significance on the CO2 emissions, and has very weakly correlated to the target variable. \n","\n","7. Since China has the highest annual CO2 emissions, it is the country with the highest CO2 emissions and severe control measures are required. \n","\n","8. Running Logistic regression through the pyomo model is good as it avoids overfitting without much requirement in preparing the data to be run through solver.\n","\n","9. We see the lowest objective value (error) for no. of variables limited at 9.\n","\n","10. Contrary to popular belief, population affects CO2 emissions our model does not clear point to a relation between emissions and total population."]}]}
